# Future.Path.Finder

This is a website where we are developing exercises and questions related to both hard and soft skills, where users can showcase their abilities to receive vocational guidance in STEM fields. The website will serve as a tool for students aspiring to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, providing guidance on which part of the acronym might be best suited for them and what career options are available within those fields.
